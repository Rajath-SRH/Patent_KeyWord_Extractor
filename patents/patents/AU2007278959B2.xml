    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">Methods for treating and preventing mucositis, in particular mucositis following the administration of chemotherapy drugs or a combination of said drugs with radiotherapy, are disclosed herein. More specifically, disclosed herein is the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of an anthocyanoside, a proanthocyanidin, or an extract containing at least one of an anthocyanoside or a proanthocyanidin for the treatment or prevention of mucositis. The therapeutically effective amount of the anthocyanoside, proanthocyanidin or extract can be administered alone or in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of an antiinflammatory agent, immunomodulating agent, analgesic, antimicrobial agent or antifungal agent. Also disclosed herein are pharmaceutical compositions for treating and preventing mucositis.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">The first aim of oncology is the complete eradication of the tumor by any means, even when this leads to serious side effects; the motto pfimum non nocere ("first, do no harm") is not used as a guideline in the treatment of tumors, but has to be replaced with primum succerrere ("first, hasten to help"). Oncological treatment normally involves radical surgery, a targeted radiotherapy including photodynamic treatment, high doses of chemotherapy drugs, radiotherapy, and the maximum tolerated dose of cytokines when patients have serious side effects. In addition to these treatments, it is established practice to administer monoclonal antibodies for specific tumors in combination with chemotherapy, which has side effects similar to those reported for the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The challenge facing the medical profession is consequently to use all available means to maximize the therapeutic result.</p>
    <p num="3">However, current treatments are not sufficiently selective to target the tumor cell alone; chemotherapy also targets all actively proliferating tissues, creating problems in the tissues similar to those caused by radiotherapy. These treatments induce necrotic processes which lead to negative immune responses, and induce serious inflammatory processes.</p>
    <p num="4">One of the side effects of radiotherapy, and above all chemotherapy, is mucositis, which normally affects the gastroenteric tract, especially the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestine and the vagina in women. The colon is involved in most cases, as are other accessible mucous membranes. Furthermore, the treatment of mucositis must be adjusted for each type of chemotherapy or anti-proliferation drug used. Mucositis may also affect the sex organs.</p>
    <p num="5">The drugs that mainly cause mucositis are anthracyclines, fluorouracyl, paclitaxel, actinomycin, mithramycin, etoposide, topotecan, amsacrine, methotrexate, hydroxyurea and combinations thereof with other chemotherapy drugs such as the platinum complexes, etc., which are the most common drugs used in oncological treatment.</p>
    <p num="6">Mucositis is a serious symptom, which adversely affects the patient's quality of life, as it makes eating difficult, and leads to infections that require the discontinuance of chemotherapy or the replacement of effective constituents of the mixtures, with a consequent reduction in the efficacy of treatment. The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy causes mucositis in 90% of patients. Mucositis is caused by immune reactions, which are still being researched, together with the direct effect of chemotherapy on actively proliferating tissues. As the mucous membranes are actively proliferating tissues, lesions that form during chemotherapy, due to thinning of the mucous layer, are normally followed by infections of bacterial, fungal and viral origin. In view of the genesis of mucositis, complete treatment generally requires systemic administration of antibiotics, antifungals or anti-inflammatory agents with immunostimulating properties, combined with topical treatments containing compounds that modulate wound-healing and prevent infection.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="16">Anthocyanosides and proanthocyanidins are substances with different action mechanisms partly associated with their chemical nature. These substances are potent antioxidants, stimulators of fibroblast proliferation and mucous production at the gastric level, potent inhibitors of proteases, (especially p-glucuronidase, hyaluronidase and collagenase), and potent wound-healing agents. A special feature is their effect on capillary fragility and permeability, which often leads to significant topical anti-inflammatory activity. Anthocyanosides and proanthocyanidins as well as compositions comprising such compounds are described in International Publication No. WO 2006/063716A1 (PCT application no. PCT/EP2005/013047), which is incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes. The most appropriate polyphenol agents will be selected, depending on the area affected by mucositis. As anthocyanosides and anthocyanidins, have a strong red coloring due to their chemical nature, they will be used for treatment of the gastroenteric tract. For treatment of sex organs or exposed skin areas, anthocyanosides will be replaced with proanthocyanidins, which are not colored and equally active for these purposes.</p>
    <p num="17">Anthocyanosides, especially glycosides of cyanidin or delphinidin or aglycones of such glycosides, which are abundantly present, for example, in the extracts of Vaccinium myrtillus and other species, have demonstrated significant preventive and curative antiulcer activity in the rat, when administered orally, in various models of experimental gastric ulcers (pylorus-ligature, reserpine, phenylbutazone, restraint, and acetic acid) without affecting gastric secretion, and increasing the mucous layer as can be demonstrated histologically. Again in the rat, these compounds protect the gastric mucosa against lesions induced by aspirin, a finding which has also been confirmed in man by measuring occult blood in the stool.</p>
    <p num="18">When administered by the gastric route, the compounds inhibit the reduction of transmucosal potential, and increase H+ backscattering induced by salicylates. All these parameters suggest that gastroprotective activity is associated with the efficiency of the mucosal barrier. In volunteers, the administration of cyanidin significantly increased the secretion of PGE2 compared with the controls, which helps to explain the gastro-protective effect of anthocyanosides. The RNA/DNA ratio and protein synthesis also increase, as does mucus secretion. The most marked phenomenon relates to mucus production and its storage after formation due to the inhibitory effect on metalloproteases, such as hyaluronidase, collagenase and glucuronidase. These actions can be documented by direct topical and systemic action. Both the anthocyanosides and the proanthocyanidins disclosed herein have a marked wound-healing activity, which is useful to protect against tissue damage.</p>
    <p num="19">It is therefore very important to use these products to treat patients who undergo chemotherapy with drugs which are well known to cause mucositis. As bacterial and/or fungal infections are particularly frequent in mucositis, a treatment, such as a topical treatment, with substances that inhibit the growth of both bacteria and fungi is particularly important. The antimicrobial or antifungal agents or substances chosen for this purpose include isoquinoline alkaloids, such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids or phenanthridine alkaloids, sanguinarine, chelerythrine and chelidonine, which inhibit the growth of Gram + and Gram - bacteria, and numerous strains of Candida and other pathogenic fungi, at nanomolar concentrations. Synthetic antifungals such as miconazole or antifungal antibiotics, and benzofurans such as eupomatenoid and its natural or synthetic analogues, can be used in combination in different ways. The advantage of the isoquinoline alkaloids, such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids or phenanthridine alkaloids, is that these compounds are only absorbed to a small extent by oral administration, are very potent antimicrobials, and possess a strong local analgesic action. In some formulations for the treatment of mucositis induced by chemotherapy drugs, it can be useful for some forms to combine isobutylamides of polyunsaturated fatty acids which possess an agonistic effect on the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors and an antiinflammatory and analgesic action.</p>
    <p num="20">Treatment with the formulations disclosed herein has the unusual feature that all the constituents of the combination are absorbed to a negligible extent on oral administration, so they can be administered on a preventive basis, before chemotherapy begins, or simultaneously, continuing the treatment between cycles to reduce the risk of mucositis. If these components are absorbed, they have an angiogenetic activity as reported in Free Radical Research, 36, 1023-31, 2002, inhibiting VEGF expression. Systemic treatment with anti-inflammatory immunostimulants involves the use of andrographolide and its natural or synthetic analogues, or the use of lactone sesquiterpenes such as parthenolide, cynaropicrin or their natural or synthetic analogues. These compounds inhibit inflammatory processes by acting on TNF-a and NF-kB, and stimulate immunological reactivity.</p>
    <p num="21">In addition to alkaloid antimicrobial agents, natural or synthetic benzofurans were chosen which present complementary activity to those agents, acting with different mechanisms.</p>
    <p num="22">The compositions disclosed herein prevent the formation of purulent plaques in the oral cavity variously infected by saprophytes, avoiding the use of antibiotics, and at the same time reducing the length of the infection. The pharmaceutical compositions to be used are mainly formulated as tablets which dissolve slowly in the oral cavity, or as chewing gums which allow slow release of the active constituents. These compositions are mainly used in preventive treatments, but also curatively, and for oral hygiene. According to a preferred aspect, the compositions disclosed herein will also contain essential oils to increase their approval rating in terms of freshness of the oral cavity. In human pharmacological treatment, the doses which have proved effective when administered in a suitable formulation range between 10 and 200 mg per tablet for anthocyanosides, proanthocyanidins or extracts comprising at least one anthocyanoside or proanthocyanidin, and a concentration of an isoquinoline alkaloid, such as a benzophenanthridine alkaloid or phenanthridine alkaloid, ranging between 2 and 10 mg per tablet, or between 0.05 and 0.2% when administered in liquid forms for gargling, etc. Also, the methods can comprise administering or the compositions can comprise extracts containing an anthocyanoside or a proanthocyanidin in amounts of about 20 mg to about 80 mg per unit dose. In some embodiments, the methods comprise administering or the compositions comprise extracts containing isoquinoline alkaloids in amounts of about 2 mg to about 20 mg per dose.</p>
    <p num="23">In particular, the compositions disclosed herein exert not only a preventive but a therapeutic effect, especially as regards the duration of the pathological form.</p>
    <p num="24">The compositions also includes pediatric formulations, such as slowdissolving gum or candy forms compatible with the stability of the active constituents. Tablets, capsules and dispersible granulates or oral liquid forms which promote close contact between the active constituents and the walls of the gastroenteric tract will be used to treat gastric and colorectal mucositis. The formulations for this specific indication cannot contain antimicrobial agents, but will always preferably contain anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating agents. The treatment will preferably be performed with anthocyanosides of Vaccinium myrtillus or Vitis vinifera at doses ranging between 50 and 500 mg per unit dose, or with cyanidin, delphinidin or pelargonidin at similar doses, with daily treatment of up to 3000 mg.</p>
    <p num="25">Proanthocyanidins, such as proanthocyanidin A2 or B2, will be used to treat mucositis of the sex organs, especially the vagina, preferably in combination with isoquinoline alkaloids, such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids or phenanthridine alkaloids, or benzofurans such as eupomatenoid and its analogues, or with terpenes such as hyperforin and its analogues and fluoroglucinols extracted from Myrtus communis or Humulus luppulus. These formulations include vaginal pessaries, foams, gels or creams, depending on the tolerability of the preparations to the damaged mucous membranes. These compositions will therefore be prepared in accordance with conventional methods, like those described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Handbook", Mack Publishing Co., N. Y., USA, together with suitable excipients.</p>
