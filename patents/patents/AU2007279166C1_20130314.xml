After. culturing for 7-10 days, the cover slips are transferred into experimental chambers for tha Tat.ch clamp studies. - Electrophysiology: The measurement chambers (volume 800 µ1) comprising the cell preparation are placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IMT2) equipped with Hoffman optics (Modulation Contrast, New York) and are observed at a magnification of 400x. The chambers are continuously perfused by gravity (2.5 ml/min) using a distributor of solutions which has 8 inlets, the single outlet of which, composed of a polyethylene tube (opening 500 pm), is placed at least 3 mm from the cell studied. The "whole cell" configuration of the patch clamp technique was used. Borosilicate glass pipettes (resistance 5-10 Mohms) are brought close to the cell using a 3D piezoelectric micromanipulator (Burleigh, PC1000). The overall currents (membrane potential set at -60 mV) are recorded with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California) connected to a PC controlled by Pclamp8 software (Axon Instruments).

    <p num="305">The application of a micromolar capsaicin solution produces an incoming cationic current with regard to the DRG cells (voltage set at -70 mV). In order to minimize the desensitization of the receptors, minimum interval of one minute between two applications of capsaicin is observed. After a control period (stabilization of the capsaicin alone response), the test compounds are applied alone at a given concentration (concentration of 10 nM or 0.1 nM) for a period of time of 4 to 5 minutes, during which several capsaicin compound tests are carried out (obtaining the maximum inhibition). The results are expressed as % of inhibition of the control capsaicin response.</p>
    <p num="306">The percentages of inhibition of the capsaicin (1 microM) response are between 20% and 100% for the most active compounds of the invention tested at a concentration of 10 nM to 0.1 nM (see example in table 2).</p>
    <p num="307">The compounds of the invention are thus effective in vitro antagonists of receptors of TRPV1 type.</p>

    <p num="311">The irritating nature of capsaicin is easily assessed on the cornea since this organ is one of the most innervated by C fibers. In this context, according to preliminary experiments, the application of a very small amount of capsaicin (2 pl at a concentration of 160 pM) at the surface of the cornea of an animal results in a number of kinds of stereotyped behavior RECEIVED TIME 2.

These include: blinking of the eye, rubbing of the instilled eye by the ipsilateral front paw, rubbing of the face with the two front paws and scratching of the ipsilateral face by the hind paw. The duration of these kinds of behavior does not exceed 2 minutes of observation and the animal then resumes its normal activity. Its appearance is furthermore also normal. The mouse does not hide in a corner with the hairs standing on end and does not develop any observable signs of suffering. It may be concluded therefrom that the duration of action of capsaicin at these doses is less than 2 minutes.</p>
    <p num="314">Summary of the methodology: The principle of the series of experiments is to determine whether the compounds of the invention can influence the behavioral response induced by a given amount of capsaicin. Capsaicin is initially diluted to 25 mM in DMSO and is diluted, for its final use, in physiological saline with 10% Tween 80. It appears, from control studies, that the solvent has no effect under these conditions.</p>
    <p num="315">In practice, the test product, prepared at 25 mM in DMSO and diluted for its final use in physiological saline with 10% Tween 80 to the stronger concentration of 500 pM, is administered in local application at the surface of the cornea under a volume of 2 p1, 10 minutes before the application of the capsaicin. The animal receives the ocular instillation of 2 gi of a 160 gm capsaicin solution prepared as indicated above. During observation for 2 minutes following the instillation, the number of rubbing actions on the instilled eye by the ipsilateral front paw is counted for each animal.</p>
