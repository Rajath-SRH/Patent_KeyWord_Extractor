    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to improved HIV, HPV, HCV, Influenza and cancer vaccines, improved methods for inducing immune responses, and for prophylactically and/or therapeutically immunizing individuals against HIV, HPV, HCV, Influenza and cancer.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The HIV genome is highly plastic due to a high mutation rate and functional compensation. This high mutation rate is driven by at least two mechanisms: the low fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) resulting in at least one mutation per replication cycle, and the dual effects of the anti-retroviral cellular factor APOBEC3G gene and viral infectivity factor Vif accessory gene. Genomes with every possible mutation and many double mutations are generated during every replication cycle, resulting in tremendous antigenic diversity. Accordingly, it has been argued that a candidate vaccine derived from an individual isolate may not elicit sufficient cross reactivity to protect against diverse circulating HIV viruses. Recent studies have suggested that consensus immunogens (Gao, F., et al. 2005. Antigenicity and immunogenicity of a synthetic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group m consensus envelope glycoprotein. J Virol 79:1154-63.; Scriba, T. J., et al. 2005. Functionally-inactive and immunogenic Tat, Rev and Nef DNA vaccines derived from sub-Saharan subtype C human immunodeficiency virus type 1 consensus sequences. Vaccine 23:1158-69) or ancestral immunogens (Doria-Rose, N. A., et al. 2005. Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 subtype B Ancestral Envelope Protein Is Functional and Elicits Neutralizing Antibodies in Rabbits Similar to Those Elicited by a Circulating Subtype B Envelope. J. Virol. 79:11214-11224; Gao, F., et al. 2004. Centralized immunogens as a vaccine strategy to overcome HIV-I diversity. Expert Rev. Vaccines 3:S161-S168; Mullins, J. L, et al. 2004. Immunogen sequence: the fourth tier of AIDS vaccine design.. Expert Rev. Vaccines 3:S151-S159; Nickle, D. C., et al. 2003. Consensus and ancestral state HIV vaccines. Science 299:1515-1517) may be useful in this regard. However, the initial studies of these approaches showed relatively modest cellular immune enhancement induced by these imm.u.nogens.</p>
    <p num="3">Recently Derdeyn et al. analyzed HIV-1. subtype C envelope glycoprotein sequences in eight African heterosexual transmission pairs and found that shorter Vi, V2 and V4 length and fewer gIyean.s are the common features shared by the sequences obtained from early transmitters (Derdeyn, C. A., et al. 2004. Envelope-constrained neutralization-sensitive HIV-1 after heterosexual transmission. Science 303:2019-2022.). This data suggests that antigens that mimic such viruses might have relevance for the early-transmitted viruses. However, such early transmitter structures have not been observed for all subtypes (Chohan, B., et al. 2005. Selection for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 envelope glycosylation variants with shorter V1-V2 loop sequences occurs during transmission of certain genetic subtypes and may impact viral RNA levels. J. Viral. 79:6528-6531). However, incorporation of shorter V loops in an envelope i.mmunogen may have other benefits, such as enhancement of sensitivity to soluble CD4 (Pickora, C., et al. 2005. Identification of two N-linked glycosylation sites within the core of the Simian Immunodificiency virus glycoprotein whose removal enhances sensitivity to soluble CD4. Virol. 79:12575-12583), and should be considered.</p>
    <p num="4">Studies have shown the importance of HIV-1 specific CTL responses in controlling viral load during acute and asymptomatic infection and the development of AIDS. However, it is unclear if current envelope based DNA vaccines are as potent as needed. Several methods have been used to increase the expression levels of HIV-1. immunogens, such as codon optimization (Andre, S., et al. 1998. increased immune response elicited by DNA vaccination with a synthetic gp120 sequence with optimized codon usage. J Virol 72:1497-503; Deml, L., et al. A. 2001. Multiple effects of codon usage optimization on expression and immunogenicity of DNA candidate vaccines encoding the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag protein. J. Virol. 75:10991-11001), RNA optimization (Muthumani, K., et al. 2003. Novel engineered HIV-1 East African Clad.e-A gp1.60 plasmid construct induces strong hurnoral and cell-mediated immune responses in vivo. Virology 314:134-46; Schneider, R., M. et al. 1997. Inactivation of the human imm.unodefici.ency virus type 1 inhibitory elements allows Rev-independent expression of Gag and Gag/protease. and particle formation. 1. Virol. 71:4892-4903) and the addition of inuriu.noglobin leader sequences that have weak RNA secondary structure (Yang, S., et al.. 2001. Induction of potent Thi-Type immune responses from a novel DNA vaccine for West Nile Virus New York Isolate (WNV-NY1999),I Infect Diseases 184:809-816).</p>

      Human. Papiliomavirus (HPV) has a circular dsDNA geno.me (7,000-8,000 base pairs). There are up to 200 different genotypes. Ph.ylogenetically, HPV is highly conserved. Mucosal HPV are Classified as "High Risk" or "Low Risk". The Low Risk group includes types 6, 11, 42, and others, Associated Diseases include: Genital Warts; Low grade cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal dysplasia; and Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis. The High Risk group includes types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58, and others. Associated Diseases include: Essential cause of Cervical cancer, pre-cancerous dysplasia; major cause of Anal, vulvar, vaginal, tonsillar cancer; and co-factor for other aerodigestive cancer. Every Day

    </p>
    <p num="6">HPV E6 and E7 proteins are tumor-specific antigens, required for tumorigenesis and maintenance of the tumor state. E7-specific immune responses are deleted in cervical cancer patients. Both E6 and E7 proteins interact specifically with the products of cellular human tumor suppressor genes, E6 with p53 and E7 with Rb (retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene). E6 and E7 are ideal immunotherapeutic targets. hTERT is a human telomerase reverse transcriptase that synthesizes a TTAGGG tag on the end of telomeres to prevent cell death due to chromosomal shortening. Embryonic cells and some germ line cells normally express hTERT to regulate homeostasis of cell populations. Cancer cells, however, exploit this mechanism of regulation to disrupt homeostasis of cell populations. For instance, hTERT over-expression occurs in more than 85% of human cancer cells, Therefore, hTERT is an ideal immunotherapeutic target. hTERT may also enhance immunotherapeutics against hyperproliferating cells expressing hTERT due to HCV or HPV infection. The E6 oncoprotein from high-risk HPV types activates human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transcription in human keratinocytes.</p>
    <p num="7">Dysplastic legions and early neoplastic legions within the liver also express hTERT at abnormally high levels. Thus, immunotherapy against HPV and HCV may be enhanced by targeting cells that express hTERT at abnormal levels. Combination immunotherapy using both hTERT and HPV or HCV proteins or nucleic acids encoding such proteins is an attractive immunotherapy.</p>
    <p num="8">Influenza H.c.magglutinin (HA) is expressed on the surface of Influenza viral particles and is responsible for initial contact between the virus and its host cell. HA is a well-known i.mmunogen. Influenza A strain fi1N5, an avian influenza strain, particularly threatens the human population because of its HA protein which, if slightly genetically reasserted by natural mutation, has greatly increased infectivity of human cells as compared to other strains of the vints. Infection of infants and older or immunocompromised adults humans with the viral H1N5 strain is often correlated to poor clinical outcome. Therefore, HA and other influenza molecules of the H1N5 strain. of Influenza are ideal immunotherapcutic targets.</p>

    <p num="110">Definitions</p>
    <p num="111">As used herein, the phrase "stringent hybridization conditions" or "stringent conditions" refers to conditions under which a nucleic acid molecule will hybridize another a nucleic acid molecule, but to no other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and wil.1 be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5°C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tin) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH and nucleic acid concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target sequence hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium. Since the target sequences are generally present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to I.0 M sodium ion (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30° C. for short probes, primers or oligonucleotides (e.g. 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60°C. for longer probes, primers or oli2onucleotides. Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents, such as formamide.</p>
    <p num="112">Sequence homology for nucleotides and amino acids may be determined using FASTA, BLAST and Gapped BLAST (Altschul et al., Nuc. Acids Res., 1997, 25, 3389, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and PAUP* 4.0b1.0 software (. D. L. Swofford, Sinauer Associates, Massachusetts). "Percentage of similarity" is calculated using PAUP* 4.0b10 software (D. L. Swofford; Sinauer Associates, Massachusetts). The average similarity of the consensus sequence is calculated compared to all sequences in the phylogenic tree (see Figures 2 and 14).</p>
    <p num="113">Briefly, the BLAST algorithm, which stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool is suitable for determining sequence similarity (Altschul. et al., J. Mal.

Center for Biotechnology Information (littp://wwmencbi.nirrunih.govi). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pair (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence that either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altsch.ul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find. HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Extension for the word hits in each direction are halted when: 1) the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum. achieved value; 2) the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or 3) the end of either sequence is reached. The Blast algorithm parameters W, T and X. determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The Blast program uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. USA, 1992, 89, 10915-10919, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 1.0, M-5, N=4, and a comparison of both strands. The BLAST algorithm (Karlin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sei, USA, 1993, 90, 5873-5787, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and Gapped BLAST perform a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences. One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to another if the smallest sum probability in comparison of the test nucleic acid to the other nucleic acid is less than about 1, preferably less than about 0.1, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001, As used herein, the term "genetic construct" refers to the DNA or RNA molecules that comprise a nucleotide sequence which encodes protein. The coding sequence includes initiation and termination signals operably linked to regulatory elements including a promoter and polyadenylation signal capable of directing expression in the cells of the individual to whom the nucleic acid molecule is administered.</p>
    <p num="114">As used herein, the term "expressible form" refers to gene constructs that contain the necessary regulatory elements operable linked to a coding sequence that encodes a protein such. that when present in the cell of the individual, the coding sequence will be expressed.</p>

    <p num="218">Construction and design of a novel subtype B early transmitter consensus-based envelope gene. The consensus sequence of HIV-1 subtype B was generated from 42 subtype B sequences retrieved from GenBank. As summarized in Fig. I, several modifications were carried out after generating the consensus sequence. Briefly, to produce a CCRS-tropic version of HIV-1 envelope that mimicked mucosally transmitted viruses, six important amino acids in the V3 loop were designed according to the sequences of early transmitter isolates. Further, ten amino acids in VI loop and one amino acid in V2 loop was also deleted from the consensus sequence. A highly efficient leader sequence was fused in frame upstream of the start codon to facilitate the expression. The transmembrane domain was kept intact to facilitate surface expression and the cleavage site was kept intact to obtain proper folding and.host proteinase cleavage of the envelope protein. The cytoplasmic tail was removed to prevent envelope recycling and to promote more stable and higher surface expression (Berlioz-Torrent, C., et al. 1999. Interactions of the cytoplasmic domains of human and simian retroviral transmembrane proteins with components of the clathrin adaptor complexes modulate intracellular and cell surface expression of envelope glycoproteins. J. Virol. 73:1350-1359; Bultrnann, A., et al.. 2001. Identification of two sequences in the cytoplamic tail of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein that inhibit cell surface expression. J. Virol. 75:5263-5276). Furthermore, in order to have a higher level of expression, the codon usage of this gene was adapted to the codon bias of Homo Sapiens genes (Andre, S., et al. B. 1998. Increased immune response elicited by DNA vaccination with a synthetic gpl 20 sequence with optimized codon usage. J Virol 72:1497-503; Deml, L., et al. 2001. Multiple effects of codon usage optimization on expression and iminunogenicity of DNA candidate vaccines encoding the human immunodeficiency virus type I gag protein. J. Virol. 75:1.0991-11001). In addition, RNA optimization (Schneider, R., et al.. 1997, Inactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 inhibitory elements allows Revindependent expression of Gag and Gag/protease and particle formation. J. Virol. 71:4892-4903) was also performed: regions of very high (&gt;80%) or very low (&lt;30%) GC content and the cisacting sequence motifs such as internal TATA boxes, chi-sites and ribosomal entry sites were avoided.

The EY2E1-B sequence, when compared with the primary isolate EK2P-B sequence, has comparable distributions of similarity scores (Table 1).

    <p num="226">To determine the antigenic epitopes, the expressed envelope proteins from the RD cell lysates were inununoprecipitated with three different gp120-specifie antibodies 2G12, 4G10 and ID6. Following the immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting was performed to detect the inunnoprecipitated proteins. Our results showed that the synthetic immunogen could bind to antibodies 2G12 and 1D6, but not 4G10. Since antibody 2G12 neutralizes a broad variety of primary isolates and reacts with a conformational and carbohydrate-dependent ep120 epitope, and antibody 1D6 binds to gp120 and gp160 and is directed against the first 204 as of gp120, our results suggested that the synthetic engineered immunogcn EY2E1-B might be able to fold into a relatively native conformation and preserve some native antigenic epitopes. Furthermore, since the antibody 4G10 is a HIV-1 LAT/B. RU V3 monoclonal antibody that recognizes LAI gp160, a T-cell line adapted strain, our data also suggested that this synthetic envelope would not utilize the c-oreceptor CXCR4.</p>
    <p num="227">To further confirm the expression and determine the antigenic epitopes, an indirect immunofluorescent assay was performed using transfected RD cells. High specific expression was observed under fluorescent microscope in the pEY2E1-B and pEK2P-B transfected cells. The HIV-1 env monoclonal F105 that reacts with a discontinuous, or conformational, gp1.20 epitope was used in the assay. As indicated in Fig. 3B, the transfected cells expressing Env proteins showed the typical rhodamine fluorescence, again suggesting the synthetic protein expressed and had a relatively native conformation. As a control, the expression was not detected in pVAX transfected RD cells.</p>
    <p num="228">Induction of humoral response. To determine whether the synthetic immunogen could elicit higher-titer envelope-specific antibody response, sera were collected from Ba1B/C mice immunized pVAX, pEY2E1-B and pEK2P-B and ELISA was performed. As shown in Fig. 4A, we observed the relatively higher level of cla.de B envelope-specific antibody responses with sera collected from pEY2E1.-B immunized mice compared to these in pEK2P-B immunized mice. In contract, the vector alone mice didn't develop specific antibody responses. However, there were not any detectable antibody responses against dale A/E and Blade C proteins in both pEY2E1-B and pEK2P-B injected mice (Fig. 4B and 4C), indicating that although the synthetic consensusbased immunogen has a relatively native conformation and preserve native antigenic epitopcs, it may not be able to induce broad cross-elade antibody immune responses.</p>
    <p num="229">Strong and broad cellular immune responses measured by ELISpot. The BalB/C mice were immunized with pEY2E1-B and pEK2P-B and ELISpot analysis was performed to determine the number of antigen-specific IFN-y secreting cells in response to four pools of peptides from HIV-I. consensus subtype B protein (Fig. 5A). The magnitude of the response as measured by the number of spot forming units (SFU) per million cells ranged from 27.5 to 520 in pEY2E1-B vaccinated mice. in comparison, splenocytes from pEK2P-B vaccinated mice only showed the range of spots from 2 to 237.5 (p&lt;0.05). The additive frequency of SFU/per million splenocytes for all four pools in pEY2El-B immunized mice was 1976.25 + 260, while the number of SFU/per million cells in pEK2P-B immunized mice was 519 + 45. Cells from mice immunized with pVAX vector were used as a negative control, showing only 60 + 5 SFU/per million splenocytes for consensus envelope B peptides pools (p &lt; 0.05). We observed sim.ilar results in three separate studies. Therefore, the pEY2El-B construct is up to four times more potent in driving cell-mediated immune responses. We also determined whether CD8+ lymphocytes were responsible for the IEN-y secretion detected in BalB/C mice immunized with pEY2EI-13. As shown in Fig. 5B, the number of SFU/per million cells was reduced to 127.5 + 11 after CD8+ depletion, indicating that there was about 90% of decrease in the frequencies of IFNy producing cells observed by CD8+ T-cell depleted ELISpot. The IFN-y production induced by pEY2E1-B is mediated mainly by CD8+ ':f-cells.</p>
    <p num="230">In addition, in order to model human T cell immune responses to HEA-A2 presented antigens and identify those antigens, we perfoinied the same ELISpot assay mentioned above using transgenic HEA-A2.1/I-12-Dd mice. As shown in. Fig 5C, the additive frequency of SFU/per million splenocytes for all four pools in pEY2E1-B immunized transgenic mice was 2362 + 257, while the number of SFU/per million cells in pEK2P-B immunized transgenic mice was only 493 + 57. These results indicated that the pEY2El-B construct is up to four times more potent in driving cell-mediated immune responses in the transgenic mice. The ELISpot data after CD8 depletion suggested that the IF'N-y production induced by pEY2E I -B is primarily mediated by CDS+ T-cells (Fig. 5D).</p>
    <p num="231">Moreover, we were interested in further detailing the cellular immune responses that were observed in the ELISpot assay. Accordingly, an additional set of ELISpot assay was performed against libraries of peptides spanning the consensus subtype B envelope protein. A complete set of 15-mer peptides overlapped by 11 amino acids, which comprise the subtype B consensus envelope protein, was used to perform this mapping study. The study illustrated that there was no clear dominant epitope induced by the synthetic envelope. However, 1FN--y ELISpot analysis of splenocytes derived from the pEY2E1-B-vaccinated BalB/C mice revealed that there were 18 pools out of 29 pools showing more than 50 spots, while there were only 6 pools in pEK2P-B vaccinated BalB/C mice (Fig. SE).

Compared to the numbers of spots against group M and subtype C peptides which were 635 + 152.3 and 345 + 82.3 in p.

The numbers of IFNI( spots in response to stimulation with four HIV group M (Fig. 6G) and subtype C (Fig. 6H) consensus envelope peptides pools in pEY2E1-B immunized transgenic mice were 2116 + 216 and 893 + 154, respectively. Compared to the numbers of spots against group M and subtype C peptides which were 473 + 50 and 266 -F. 55 in pE. K2P-B vaccinated transgenic mice, these data indicated that the cross-lade immune responses elicited by pEY2E1-B is about three to four times stronger than those induced by pEK2P-B in transgenic mice. Moreover, two subtype C isolate peptide sets that should serve as a stringent control for evaluating breadth and cross-reactivity achieved by other peptide sets were used to further determine the cross-clade C immune responses. Although there were not too many differences of cross reactivity against these two subtype C isolate sets elicited by pEY2E1-B and pEK2P-B in BaiB/C mice (Fig. 6D and E), the eross-elade reactivity against these two subtype C isolate sets induced by pEY2El-B is about three times stronger than those induced by pEK2P-B (Fig. 61 and J).

      Worldwide :141V-1 DNA vaccine efforts have been guided by the principle that HIVspecific T-cell responses may provide some contribution to protection from infection or control of replication post-infection. DNA vaccines can impact viral replication although in general they are not as potent in immune induction as attenuated live viral vectors (Almond, N., et al.. 1995. Protection by attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus in macaques against challenge with virus-infected cells. Lancet 345:1342-1.344; Berman, P. W., et al. 1996.

Protective effects of a live attenuated SIV vaccine with a deletion in the nef gene. Science 258:1938-1941). Strategies aimed at improving the breadth and magnitude of the cellular immune responses are therefore important. The present invention provides a novel antigen using several features of immunogens that have been reported in the literature as separate approaches, but have not been previously assembled together in one vaccine modality. As proof of concept, a synthetic engineered consensus-based envelope immunogen was developed and compared with an optimized primary sequence immunogen for induction of cell-mediated immune responses. Expression data showed that this engineered new envelope gene could be efficiently expressed in mammalian cell lines although the expression levels of these two immunogens were very similar (Fig. 3A). We observed in the immunogenicity studies that the cellular immune responses induced by this functional immunogen exhibited increased diversity and magnitude compared to the primary envelope vaccine. Epitope mapping data obtained in both Ba1B/C and HLA.-A2 transgenic mice demonstrated that this diversity and magnitude improvement was maintained across these haplotypes. To further confirm this finding, we also developed a consensus-based subtype C envelope immunogen and compared it with a primary• subtype C immunogen, again the synthetic consensus-based subtype C envelope immunogen exhibited enhanced diversity and magnitude of cellular immune responses compared to the primary C immunogen. (unpublished data).

    <p num="237">From the point of view of vaccine design strategy, sequence homology between the vaccine candidate and the infecting or challenging virus may be an important consideration. An effective approach to minimize the depee of sequence dissimilarity between a vaccine strain and contemporary circulating viruses is to create artificial sequences that are "central" to these viruses. One strategy to design such a. sequence is to use a consensus sequence derived front the most common amino acid in every position in an alignment. In this study, we developed a consensus-based subtype B envelope vaccine and thought this synthetic immunogen would have higher cross reactivity. Our results did show that there was a diversity of cellular immune responses induced by the pEY2E1-B vaccine. Peptide mapping results in both Balblc and transgenic mice as well indicated that the EY2E1-B immunogen broadened the immune responses. Moreover, the results of cross-reactive cellular immune responses study indicated that pEY2E1-B could elicit significantly strornaer and broader cross-reactive cellular immune responses. Therefore, the artificial consensus envelope immunogens contain more conserved epitopes than found in any individual natural isolate and they induce broader cross-cl.ade CTL responses.</p>
    <p num="238">A consensus sequence theoretically has advantages and disadvantages. Since a consensus sequence is generated based on contemporary isolates, it may be genetically closer to current circulating viral strains than any given natural virus isolate. However, since global sequencing is generally conducted with viruses sampled during chronic infections instead of viruses sampled during acute infection, developing a consensus vaccine response on epitopes that for the most part have escaped may be a disadvantage. To minimize this disadvantage, one useful strategy for vaccine design would be to take early transmitter sequences into account. Envelope proteins are among the most difficult IRV proteins to construct artificially because the hypervariable regions in HIV-1 envelope gene evolve by rapid insertion and deletion and not by point mutation. The difference of hypervariabl.e regions in length makes it hard to generate the consensus sequences of these regions. Recently, Gao et al. (Gao, F., Bet al. 2005. Antigenicity and immunogenicity of a synthetic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group in consensus envelope glycoprotein. J Vim]. 79:1154-63) generated a group M consensus envelope sequence, however, the nonconsensus sequences from corresponding regions of a CRFO8 BC recombinant strain were used in these variable regions. Studies have indicated that subtype C viruses encoding envelope glycoproteins with shorter V1, V2 and V4 regions are transmitted in recipients with a frequency significantly greater than would be expected by chance. The subtype A envelope sequences from early infection also had significant shorter V1 and V2 loop sequences and fewer potential Nlinked glycosylation. sites (Chohan, B., D. et al. 2005. Selection for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 envelope glycosylation. variants with shorter V I-V2 loop sequences occurs during transmission of certain genetic subtypes and may impact viral RNA levels. J. Virol. 79:6528-6531). In contrast, recently transmitted subtype B variants didn't have shorter V1 and V2 loops. However, it may be important to note the subtype B infection cases were primarily the result of homosexual transmission or drug injection use. Moreover, studies have suggested that a possible functional consequence of having a compact V1, V2 region is to increase exposure of the CD4 binding domain, and then to enhance susceptibility to neutralization (Edwards, T. G., et al. 2001. Relationships between CD4 independence, neutralization sensitivity, and exposure of a CD4-induced epitope in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus type I envelope protein. J. Virol. 75:5230-5239; Kolchirisky, P., et al. 2001. Increased neutralization sensitivity of CD4-independent Human Immnuodeficiency Virus variants, J. Viral. 75:2041-2050; Pickora, C., et al. 2005. Identification of two N-linked glycosylation sites within the core of the Simian Immunodificiency virus glyeoprotein whose removal enhances sensitivity to soluble CD4. J.

CD4 independent of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Envs is associated with macrophage tropism, neutralization sensitivity, and attenuated pathogenicity. J. Virol. 76:2595-2605). We shortened the VI and V2 regions when we generated the subtype B consensus sequence.</p>
    <p num="239">The early phase of HIV-1. infection is dominated by non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) viruses, which replicate slowly and use CCRS as their main coreceptor. Syncytium-inducing (SI) viruses, which emerge in about 50% of infected individuals preceding an accelerated CD4 cell decline and progressive clinical course. of infection, use CXCR4 as the main coreceptor. A differential coreceptor usage of HIV variants has been demonstrated for all subtypes. Subtype C viruses appear to be different from most other subtypes because an underrepresentation of CXCR4 using HIV variants in subtype C has frequently been reported. Therefore, CCRS utilization should be a very crucial consideration for a vaccine design.. Previous reports showed that the V3 region of gp120 plays an important role in coreceptor utilization. Six residues in V3 loop has been identified to be critical for CCRS interaction: arginine307, lysine314, isoleucine316, arginine322, phenylalanine324 and alanine337. However, based on the sequences of subtype C early transmitters, the residue at position 322 should be glutamine instead of arginin.e. in summary, based on the previous studies showing residues important for CCR5 utilization and the sequences of early transmitters, we designed the subtype B consensus envelope immunogen that could drive immune responses that may in theory target CCR5 coreceptor</p>
    <p num="240">To maximize potential cross-reactivity, a HIV-I group M consensus envelope sequence has been created. However, it is possible that subtype-specific envelope consensus vaccines may represent a compromise for the overall sequence similarity of the vaccine antigen relative to circulating viruses at least at the level of cellular immune responses. Studies have shown that there were high rates of selection identified in different regions of subtype B and C envelope proteins. This may be caused by different immune pressure on different regions of the envelope protein in subtype B and C. Therefore, there may be advantages in using a subtype-specific envelope vaccine, as the immune responses to the vaccine and the circulating virus would share antigenic domains. More experiments comparing group M and subtype-specific envelope vaccines are needed to further clarify this issue.</p>
    <p num="241">Another important concern about using a consensus sequence is that its sequence may associate polymoiphisms in combinations not found in any natural virus, thus potentially resulting in improper protein conformations. Previous studies has indicated that a group M consensus immunogen could fold into native conformation, preserve envelope antigenic epitopes and elicit weak neutralizing antibody response. Based on the facts that the synthetic protein could bind to antibodies 2G12, ID6 and F105, we. think that the pEY2E-1-B may have somewhat native structural confirmations. Importantly, our data also demonstrated that EY2E1-B immunogen could induce a higher-titer subtype B envelope-specific antibody, indicating this synthetic immunogen may preserve more ClassIl epitopes as well. More studies in this area will be important.</p>
    <p num="242">With the generation anew HIV-1 vaccine strategies, there is also an increasing demand to predict the efficacy of these vaccines in human using preclinical. models. In our study, HLAA2 transgenic mice were used to study the cellular immune responses elicited by the synthetic immunogen. Studies have shown that this transgenic strain is an important preclinical model for design and testing of vaccines for infectious diseases involving optimal stimulation of human CD8+ cytolytic T cells. In this model. the results indicated that EY2E1-B could elicit much broader and stronger cellular immune responses compared to EK2P-B, suggesting that this new vaccine may have more potential to induce HLA.-A2-restricted cellular responses. Further study of this immunogen in non-human primates are being planned.</p>

      Taken together, our results suggest that EY2E1B could serve as an immunogen that increases both the magnitude and breadth of CTL responses as a DNA vaccine cassette. In more general terms, this construct may be useful in other platforms for induction of stronger and broader cellular immune responses against HIV strains in non-DNA vector approaches. Example 2 Development of a Novel Engineered IIIV-1 Clade C Envelope DNA Vaccine that Enhances Diversity and Breadth of the Elicited Cellular Immune Response Strong HIV-1 specific CTL responses have an important role in managing viral load during acute and asympto:matic infection. However, recent studies on consensus immunogens have not been able to noticeably demonstrate improved cellular immune responses. Here we test a novel engineered Clade C consensus-based envelope immunogen for improved cellular immune response. The novel vaccine (pEY3F1-C) was created from the HIV-1 Clade C consensus envelope sequence. Several modifications were performed including shortening the highly variable VI and V2 regions based on early transmitter sequence, retention of the V3 loop for CCR5 utilization, removal of the cytoplasmic tail region from the C-terminus to prevent envelope recycling, and retention of the cleavage site and TMD for proper folding. Also, an IgE leader sequence was added to the N-terminus. This consensus DNA vaccine was also RNA optimized and codon optimized. The cellular immune response was studied in BalB/C mice via ELiSpot and epitope mapping assays. When studied as a DNA vaccine, compared to pEK3P-C (derived from a primary isolate of Clade C env), our construct (pEY3E1-C) was more effective at driving a cellular immune response. pEY3E1-C elicited a cellular immune response greater in magnitude than pEK3P-C when stimulated by Consensus Clade C peptides. Additionally, the consensus immunogen. elicited an increase in the magnitude of the cellular immune response when stimulated by two other sets of primary isolate peptides also from Oale C. In addition to augmented magnitude, enhanced breadth of the CTL response was supported by the pEY3E1.-C's ability to induce at least 15 out of 29 strongly reactive peptide pools (having more than 50
      <sup>.</sup>
      spots/per million splenucytes), while pEK3P-C only induced 3 out of 29 pools and 9 out of 29 pools with strong reactivity in response to two primary isolate peptide sets, which were selected for their uniqueness and ability to serve as a stringent control for evaluating breadth. Furthermore, pEY3El-C elicited a stronger Cross-Clade cellular immune response when stimulated with Clade B peptides. The consensus immunogen pEY3E1-C enhances both the magnitude and breadth of CTL responses as a DNA vaccine cassette, suggesting that the potential for consensus immunogens to serve as a component antigen in a HIV vaccine cocktail merits further examination.

    <p num="244">With wide genetic diversity, rapid mutation, and recombination of the existing strains, the difficulty of generating an effective vaccine is tremendous.

      PBMCs), which were further enhanced with IL-12 eo-injection (1238 :I:: SEM SEM PBMCs).

    <p num="303">I. Memory I cell Responses</p>
    <p num="304">
      An important issue is to be able to improve the generation of memory responses with the DNA platform. We performed ELISpot analysis five months after the last DNA vaccination (Figure 3). In the IM groups, the addition of plasmid IL-12 resulted in nearly a 10-fold increase in memory cells (751 + 11.1 and 78.6 ± 16-9 SFU/10' PBMCs). It is clear that IL-12 can positively impact this important 1' cell phenotype. The number of antigen-specific IFtiy producing cells was substantial in. the EP group as well, however the IL-1.2 adjuvant t- EP resulted in the most. robust memory response (1231 ± 523.5 and 3795 ± 1336 SFU/10
      <sup>6</sup>
      PBMCs respectively), a response showing that the combined technology drives very strong T cell memory responses.

    <p num="305">Humoral immune responses to DNA vaccines</p>
    <p num="306">A weakness of IM DNA vaccine technology lies in its inability to induce clear antibody responses in non-human primates and in human clinical studies. We evaluated each group's ability to induce both HIV-1 gag and env specific antibody titers to recombinant p24 and gp160 antigens in an ELI. SA format. For both antigens, the IM and IM T IL-12 groups did not show significant antibody titers (&lt;1:50 endpoint titer). The eleetroporated groups exhibited dramatically higher gag antibody titers that were able to bind to recombinant p24. Although both the EP and the EP + 1L-12 groups had similar endpoint titers at week 12 (22,400 and 12,800 respectively), the EP + IL-12 group generated a more efficient antibody response. That response appeared earlier in the immunization scheme and rose to the maximum level quickest. The env antibody responses also reflected the results we observed with the gag antigen, albeit with lower endpoint titers.</p>

      Having observed substantial ELISpot responses, we next examined additional parameters of cellular immunity. We examined the ability of gag specific CD41

Cryopreserved samples, collected two weeks after the final immunization, were stimulated and analyzed by CFSE assay. The average CD4' response increased similar to that observed in the ELISpot assay. By comparison, the CD8 proliferation induction was much more dramatic in magnitude. We observed that IL-12 increased CDS

      T cell proliferation over IM alone and EP was substantially higher. The EP ± IL-12 group had the highest percentage of CD8' cells that were able to proliferate after in vitro stimulation (2.51 ± SEM

      /0 and 4.88 ± SEM %, respectively). Obvious CD8 T cell proliferation bands were observed in the EP + IL-12 demonstrating the potent proliferative potential of this combined immunization.

    <p num="309">Polvfunctional CD8' T cell responses</p>
    <p num="310">
      Although we have clearly observed the induction of a robust IFNy effector response following EP and 1L-12 co-immunization, we wanted to further characterize the functions of the antigen specific CD8
      <sup>}</sup>
      T cell responses in the various arms. Samples taken three months following the final immunization were stimulated with gag peptides and stained for intracellular cytokine production of IFNy, TNFa and IL-2. Out of all groups, only one animal in the IM + IL12 and one animal in the EP only group had a detectable IFNy response. However two out of the three animals in the EP + IL-12 immunized goup had gag-specific

      1ENy producing CD8' T cells. The IM + IL- 12 responder had a small percentage of polyfunctional cells that stained for all three cytokines as well as a population that had lost its ability to produce IL-2. The EP responder had slightly higher polyfunctional responses that were comprised of four different populations. The most dramatic response was seen in the second EP + IL-12 animal. More than 2% of its CD8 T cells were able to produce all three cytokines and 2% were able to produce both IFNy and TNFa. Clearly the number of animals in each group is low and requires additional primate studies to confirm these results, however collectively the trends observed appear clear and encouraging.
    </p>
    <p num="311">Discussion</p>
    <p num="312">IL-12 as a DNA vaccine adjuvant improved ELISpot responses several fold over plasmid alone. In addition proliferation was clearly enhanced. The EP group exhibited a higher average response than either IM group alone or the IM + IL-12 arm exhibiting a combined ELISpot response that was 3x higher than the IM + IL-12 group. The best ELISpot responses were observed in the EP + IL-12 arm, which was almost 4x over the IM+IL-12 arm 19x IM alone.</p>
    <p num="313">After each immunization the magnitude of the antigen-specific response by IFNy</p>
    <p num="314">ELISpot was determined. After a single immunization all of the animals in the EP and EP + IL12 groups not only had detectable responses, they had averages that were higher than those seen in the IM group after three immunizations. After two immunizations, IFNy responses in the EP and EP + IL-12 groups were comparable to responses that have been reported in studies using viral vectors. Substantial memory responses were observed in the IM + IL-12 and both EP groups five months after the last immunization.</p>
    <p num="315">IM immunization, with or without IL-12, did not result in a significant amount of antibody. Electroporation was able to enhance the humor immune response as reported previously. All of the animals in the electroporated groups seroconverted. Although the EP and the EP + IL-12 groups had similar endpoint titers after three immunizations the kinetics of antibody induction was slightly faster in the EP + 1L-12 group.</p>
    <p num="316">The proliferative capacity of CD8 T cells appeared to be enhanced with EP and plasmid 1L-12. This data supports the memory expansion observed in the ELISpot assay where expansion of antigen specific T cell is likely a result of the enhanced proliferative potential of the EP+ IL-12 arm.</p>
